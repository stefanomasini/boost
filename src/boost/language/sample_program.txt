# This command rotates the head A (left) to the right
# (i.e. Counter-ClockWise if you look from top)
# It goes at speed 3 and stops when it reaches position 12
right(A, to=12, speed=3)

# This command starts rotating head B to the left
# Note that heads A and B start rotating at the same time
left(B, speed=2)

# Wait 3 seconds

# Then stop head B
# Note that at this point head A has probably already
# reached position 12, and has therefore stopped
stop(B)

# Wait 10 seconds...

# Then restart from the beginning, forever
